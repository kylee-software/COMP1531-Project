GROUP REFLECTION FOR ITERATION ONE:
    - need to consider the sequence of features earlier on to appropriately
      distribute our effort and ensure earlier functions are completed in their
      entirety earlier on.
    - procedures regarding what to do and what to check before starting any work
      session would be beneficial to ensure everyone knows what other people are 
      doing and our time is spent most effectively
    - more peer coding could be beneficial in keeping style consistent
    - variable names and types need to be considered very carefully so that integration
      goes smoothly:
        - for example in iteration one the channels functions were written using a 
          dict as the auth user id input whereas the other functions were written assuming
          it was an int, which causes issues when merging everything together
