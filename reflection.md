## GROUP REFLECTION FOR ITERATION ONE:
- need to consider the sequence of features earlier on to appropriately distribute our effort and ensure earlier functions are completed in their entirety earlier on.
- procedures regarding what to do and what to check before starting any work session would be beneficial to ensure everyone knows what other people are doing and our time is spent most effectively
- more peer coding could be beneficial in keeping style consistent
- variable names and types need to be considered very carefully so that integration goes smoothly:
    - for example in iteration one the channels functions were written using a dict as the auth user id input whereas the other functions were written assuming it was an int, which causes issues when merging everything together

## GROUP REFLECTION FOR ITERATION TWO AND THREE:
- more regular meetings would have ensured we all used helper functions/worked on solutions together more efficiently
- code reviews should be more extensive to catch errors
- documentation is important, and updating regularly and sharing the load more would ensure everyone knows what is happening at all times.
