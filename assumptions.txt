Assumptions for channels_create_v1:
    auth_register_v1() works and returns correct auth_user_id
    auth_login_v1() works and that the user is login in order to create a channel
    only need to raise exception when the length of the channel name is greater than 20 characters
    only test

    channel_create works and creates correct channel names and id's
    only have to test for length of returns channels list
    auth_register works
    returns a dictionary with key 'channels' and value [] if no channels have been created
    only testing user created channels for simplicity not joined channels as channel_join is assumed to be working
