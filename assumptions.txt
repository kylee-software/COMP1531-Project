Assumptions for channels_list_v1:
    channel_create works and creates correct channel names and id's
    only have to test for length of returns channels list
    auth_register works
    returns a dictionary with key 'channels' and value [] if no channels have been created
    only testing user created channels for simplicity not joined channels as channel_join is assumed to be working
